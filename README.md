narhiril's Legends of Forlorn Realms hasn't been updated in a while. Being my favorite mod that I never made, I want to fix that.

Mostly on github for backup purposes while in the process of updating. Might make use of issues to keep up what needs updating.

This will be almost entirely an update. I will not add features or impose my "vision" or whatever except where a judgement call has to be made on new content or raws made to fix an issue that has been fixed in vanilla.

I want to emphasize: this ain't my mod, it's narhiril's. I'm only doing updating.
